    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Pho got its start in northern Vietnam around the beginning of the twentieth century. The exact circumstances are unclear, but Vietnam’s signature noodle soup resulted from cultures rubbing shoulders. There are many theories about the original pho but one good explanation points to a glut of beef parts – bones, offal, and tough cuts leftover from French colonialists slaughtering cows for their tender steaks. Locals were enjoying a water buffalo-based rice vermicelli noodle soup.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>5 pounds beef soup bones</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon salt, divided</li>
        <li>2 gallons water</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>

        <li>
        Make broth: Place beef bones in a 9-quart (or larger) pot; season with 1 teaspoon salt. Pour water into the pot and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer broth for about 2 hours.
        </li>

        Meanwhile, set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Line a 10x15-inch roasting pan with aluminum foil.      
        </li>
        <li>
        Place onions and unpeeled ginger onto the prepared roasting pan and cook under the preheated broiler, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are charred, 10 to 15 minutes.
